My research interests lie primarily in developing statistical and computational methods to address public health problems by data integration from large datasets. Below I will introduce my current accomplishments in more detail.

**Jingning Zhang**, Jianan Zhan, Jin Jin, Cheng Ma, Ruzhang Zhao, Jared O' Connell, Yunxuan Jiang, 23andMe Research Team, Bertram L Koelsch, Haoyu Zhang, Nilanjan Chatterjee. An ensemble penalized regression method for multi-ancestry polygenic risk prediction. Prepared for submission to Nature Methods 2021+ [\[Slides\]](https://github.com/Jingning-Zhang/PROSPER/blob/main/PROSPER.pdf)

- Manuscript prepared for submission to \textit{Nature Methods}.
- Proposed a novel method for generating multi-ancestry Polygenic Risk scOres based on enSemble of PEnalized Regression models (PROSPER) for predicting complex traits / disease risk using only genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary statistics.
- In simulation and real data analyses, PROSPER has substantial improvement compared to alternative methods across a wide variety of genetic architectures, and is an order of magnitude faster than an existing multi-ancestry method (PRS-CSx).
